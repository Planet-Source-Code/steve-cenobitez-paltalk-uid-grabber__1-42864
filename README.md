## Paltalk UID Grabber


</div>

### Description

This code was written in around 10 mins and is like all my programs very modular, It basicly grabs a users UID or Username in paltalk if you are an Admin (@) in a room, or a Red Admin, bu then Red Admin dont use 3rd Party Apps :)

All you need to do is choose that you want to grab in the program then right click a user in your rooms name, and click Get UID it will then copy the user name or UID to the clipboard for later use..

This is the first of much paltalk code, I have a hell of alot of paltalk code that i will be releasing, also coming soon will be Voodoo Chat (www.voodoochat.vom) code!
